# Advanced Functional Programming in Agda

This repository is a collection of some of the material that I used for the Agda portion of the Utrecht University course on Advanced Functional Programming.
The `cockx` folder contains the tutorial assignments by Jesper Cockx, besides that, the `demo.agda` file contains examples by Wouter Swierstra.

More interestingly, the following files are relevant to my coursework:
- `prelude.agda` : Collection of my custom 'prelude-like' datatypes and functions, required for the assignment.
- `notes.agda` : Scratchpaper for Agda experiments, currently houses unused 'prelude-like' functions.
- `assignment.agda` : Assignments in Agda, requires `prelude.agda` in the same folder.
